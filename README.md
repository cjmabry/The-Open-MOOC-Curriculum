# The-Open-MOOC-Curriculum
Clever name coming soon.

###What?
An online resource that provides free, open source curriculums for students who wish to learn for free online.

Curriculums mirror those from bachelor's programs from acclaimed schools, and each class on the curriculum links to various resources on the web where users can take said classes. Curriculums can be edited and refined through an upvote and discussion system similar to Reddit.

Students can create an account and tailor a curriculum to themselves, checking off items after completion of courses around the web.

###Why?
There is a plethora of high quality resources to learn virtually anything online, for free. These resources are spread throughout the internet, however, and not only is finding the best course for a certain skill online difficult, but it is extremely hard for students to know what to study, due to most online courses being one-off, specific classes and having no accompanying curriculum. 

###How?
We'll be using [Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask), [Boostrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), and love.

###Can I contribute?
Of course! Fork the project and make a pull request, open an issue, or contact me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cjmab28) with questions, comments, concerns, suggestions, and/or love.
